I want dark willow more than anything I've ever wanted in my entire life. Imagine your childhood desire to receive a coveted toy, or your urge to eat your favorite meal after a long day. Now imagine this urge tenfold. Nay, hundredfold. I imagine us basking in each other's glow while we sit in front of the fireplace. The Shawshank Redemption is on, but we're not really paying attention, because we can't stop thinking about pressing our bodies together and creating the beautiful musical melody of love and passion. I enter her as we become one singular being, a being of lust and yet, simultaneously, of tenderness. These thoughts have consumed my life. It started out small: I would think of plunging my chivalrous shaft into her luscious pink body during lunchtime or a spare moment. But this built and built until all I can think of, during all hours of the day, is serenading Dark Willow with my harmonious love songs that I wrote just for her while I caress her pink body, the encapsulation of sensuality, and engulf myself within her pink radiance. I imagine her wings closing us off from the rest of the humanity as we engage in unspeakable escapades within our own private little world. That's what I want. That's what I need.
