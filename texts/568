It was the year of our lord, 18XX, and as was seemingly well in the carrot kingdom. But what all carrot citizens and even the carrot lord Stephen himself were weary of was the looming Rewind(TM) Tower to the north. Rewind(TM) Incorporated was said to be developing Carrot 2. And this would threaten the lives of all carrots, unless of course they had a bios update. One day Sten the carrot lord was walking atop his mountain top carrot farm when he noticed that his irrigation ditches had frozen over. Either winter had come early or he had just had it built too high on a mountain biome. But what he then saw was even worse; in a combination of the ice and magical carrot juices, what had been created was Vanilla Ice. His raps were too much for most of the carrota to handle so most on the mountain top died. This became known as the great carrot massacre of 18X7 +/- 3.
